Hello, world!

I'm a wannabe game programmer, writer, and 3D artist. I'm also an art school dropout, having studied game design before attending UIS for a BS majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematical sciences.
Lowest GPA at Tolarian Community College. I'm becoming working-proficient in Korean, and learning Japanese for fun (looking forward to Shashingo!). I was a features writer at Make Use Of, Hardcore Droid, and Game Rant; writing technical guides, game reviews, and stories about tech and games.
Currently, I'm a 3D artist for Spellcast Studios' Ardenfall.
